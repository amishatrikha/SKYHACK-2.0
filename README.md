Driving Efficiency:  Reducing AHT and AST for Superior  Customer Satisfaction

# Problem Statement:
As United Airlines continues its journey to become the best airline in the history of aviation, it is crucial to provide world-class customer service, for which one of the key areas of focus is our call center operations. Call centers play a critical role in ensuring customer issues are resolved quickly and efficiently, but we face challenges in improving metrics such as Average Handle Time (AHT) and Average Speed to Answer (AST).

The task here is to optimize these key call center metrics, helping reduce resolution times and providing faster, more efficient service to our customers. You are required to analyze our existing call center data to identify inefficiencies, determine the drivers of long AHT and AST, and suggest strategies to enhance customer satisfaction, reduce escalations, and improve overall operational efficiency.
